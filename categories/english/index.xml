&lt;p>I believe that humans evolved through language.

This new workflow has transformed my development journey, removing the stress of figuring out &lt;em>how&lt;/em> to do things. Now, I just focus on &lt;em>what&lt;/em> needs to be done.&lt;/p>

This definition excludes other types of visual languages, like hieroglyphics, which are pictures or symbols representing words. While similar to emojis, hieroglyphics are a type of alphabet.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
