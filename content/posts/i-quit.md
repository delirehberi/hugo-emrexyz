I quit smoking 20~ days ago. It was the time for that. I was feel that. So I decide to not smoke anymore and i didn't, i will not. I don't want to smoke anymore, i did for 12 years and it is enough. I want to live healthy, i want to breath to fresh air.

These are my advises to who wants to quit;

Do not push yourself; at first, you have to accept the smoking is wrong, otherwise you can not leave it. You have to understand that with your whole consciousness, read about that, think about it, spend your time before quit smoking with trying to accept the "smoke is wrong". You have to feel in your hearth "this is wrong, i do not want to that"

Then, everything will be great...
