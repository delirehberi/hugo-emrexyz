I am writing my blog posts in markdown for a long time. And I am using hugo to publish in emre.xyz domain and using github as hosting for my static content. 

I wrote about [nostr](https://emre.xyz/posts/nostr) and then I started to plan to move my blog to nostr network. But still I want to use hugo because I have other pages than blog posts and not fully ready to use nostr for everything. 

So, I've decided to build [hugo2nostr](https://github.com/delirehberi/hugo2nostr) tool to sync my hugo content with nostr network. 

Its a very basic tool. Actually it just bunch of scripts. After checkout just need to configure environment variables like hugo content directory, nostr private key, relays. Then it just reads all posts and publish to nostr network. 

You can review repo for codes and you can see the result in [my nostrudel profile](https://nostrudel.ninja/u/npub1gmeu0wenescpjpymwmwgnkaedc6vy3aamf5tdtvxxf5z0yll3gdqatwl3v/articles)

This blog post will not be accessible in emre.xyz yet, because I did not complete reverse-sync feature yet. Its only publish hugo posts to nostr. 

I am using [obsidian nostr extension](https://github.com/jamesmagoo/nostr-writer) to write this post. After I've complete reverse-sync feature, it will be accessible over emre.xyz too. 

I will continue to develop new nostr apps and scripts I think. Follow and reshare to support me, and of course always you can send zaps :)
